      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motivation to clean this dataset is from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000921&#34;&gt;Mukherjee et al. (2021, JFE)&lt;/a&gt;. In this paper, the authors documented that one can get ahead-of-announcement estimation about the storage hubs for crude oil in the US from satellite images and trade on it. This will decrease the market reaction around the release of official figures because the oil storage information has been partially revealed during the traders&amp;rsquo; arbitrage before announcement due to traders&amp;rsquo; use of satellite images. To establish the causality between traders&amp;rsquo; satellite image use and the lower market reaction around official figure release, this paper adopted cloudiness in the storage sites as Instrument Variable because the satellite images will be more obscure and thus less useful when the weather is cloudy. It turns out that the lowered market reaction is indeed less prominent during cloudy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

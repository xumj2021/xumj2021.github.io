      <description>Introduction I find Google Search is a fairly nice platform as an integrated information source, especially when the information that you want has not been collected by the existed database, or - you think it&amp;rsquo;s not worthwhile to pay for it.&#xA;For example, in my last project, I need to collect firms&amp;rsquo; Twitter account for 3000+ different companies. However, there is no established database which I have access to.&#xA;The solution I found is to submit firm name or firm Ticker plus &amp;lsquo;Twitter Account&amp;rsquo; to Google search, record the most relevant search results, and write them into my excel sheet - That is basically what I would do if I am hand-collecting the data and means huge workload if I actually do it.</description>

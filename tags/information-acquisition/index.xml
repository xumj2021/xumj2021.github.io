      <description>Introduction Decades ago, less than 15% of earnings announcements were released after 4 PM. In these limited after-hour earnings releases, a significant portion was with bad news. Presumably, managers with bad news were taking advantage of the fact that far fewer traders are active in after-market hours compared to during trading hours, or that they are distracted by other issues (Patell and Wolfson, 1982 TAR).

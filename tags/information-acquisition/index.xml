      <description>Introduction Unlike the market during trading hours, the after-hours market is characterized by an illiquid trading environment, high trading costs, a high degree of information asymmetry, low trading volume, and most importantly, relatively &amp;lsquo;inactive&amp;rsquo; market participants (Barclay and Hendershott, 2004 JF), all making it challenging to trace information incorporation and price discovery in the after-hours market.&#xA;On the other hand, to avoid the excess volatility during the trading hours and allow more time for investors to acquire and integrate the information into their valuation assessments, firms and regulators have become more prone to release material news outside trading hours in recent years.</description>

      <description>Motivation Just like the trading imbalance could be a powerful signal for upcoming stock price movement, investors&amp;rsquo; information acquisition actions are also indicative for future security returns. According to Lee and So (2015), acquiring information is costly for investors and thus they only do so when the expected profits can cover the relative costs.

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/mengjiexu/&#34;&gt;My research&lt;/a&gt; centers around how market participants act upon their perceived informational advantages over others. And because of this, I have always found it intriguing to leverage people&amp;rsquo;s digital traffic in accessing firms&amp;rsquo; EDGAR filings to capture the dynamics of market participants&amp;rsquo; information sets. During my explorations, I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://IPinfo.io/&#34;&gt;IPinfo.io&lt;/a&gt; generously provided all the registered users with the bulk data for organization to which the IP address is registered. Per their invitation, I am pleased to share my methods on distinguishing EDGAR downloads from different stakeholder groups, especially those from the retail and institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like the trading imbalance could be a powerful signal for upcoming stock price movement, investors&amp;rsquo; information acquisition actions are also indicative for future security returns. According to Lee and So (2015), acquiring information is costly for investors and thus they only do so when the expected profits can cover the relative costs. Ceteris paribus, securities which attract more investor attention may have a higher likelihood of experiencing abnormal stock volatility from which a sophisticated investor can cultivate Alphas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>Motivation The WRDS-SAS Studio seems to be suspended soon. As a big fan of this cloud platform, I have to find something alternative to make my data extraction from WRDS replicable. Compiled from a series of WRDS guidances (you can find them in the Reference part), this blog will introduce how to exploit WRDS cloud via Python.&#xA;The biggest advantage of WRDS Cloud is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to download everything to your computer but just deal with the massive data using the computing source of WRDS Cloud.</description>

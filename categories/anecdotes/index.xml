      <description>Recently, I came up with several unexpected links between the books or newspapers I am (or have been) exposed to and some fascinating papers published in top economic journals. In this blogpost, I will record the main ideas of those economic papers and their respect highly relevant alternative information sources. As such links are highly likely to accumulate in the future, this blogpost will be updated now and then.&#xA;By summarizing the information sources which might motivate or inspire top journal articles, one might learn not only how to discover innovative research topics but also how to transfer his/her eureka moment to a solid economic paper.</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since retail investors’ last major moves on dot-com stocks in the late 1990s, they have been&#xA;largely silent from the capital market for decades until the COVID time. Compared to previous&#xA;retail trading waves, the recent retail influx is characterized by unprecedented market power, fueled by crowdsourced investing ideas from online forums, one-click trading convenience, and greater access to news outlets.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Looking back, it&amp;rsquo;s tempting to attribute the recent retail influx to COVID, which left people stuck at home with ample time and spared cash due to quarantine and layoffs. However, this cannot explain why retail investors have remained an influential force even after returning to the office.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>When Earnings Announcements Go After 4 PM</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/after-hour-trading-and-information-processing/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the market during trading hours, the after-hours market is characterized by an illiquid trading environment, high trading costs, a high degree of information asymmetry, low trading volume, and most importantly, relatively &amp;lsquo;inactive&amp;rsquo; market participants (Barclay and Hendershott, 2004 JF), all making it challenging to trace information incorporation and price discovery in the after-hours market.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, to avoid the excess volatility during the trading hours and allow more time for investors to acquire and integrate the information into their valuation assessments, firms and regulators have become more prone to release material news outside trading hours in recent years. Take the firms&amp;rsquo; earnings announcements as an example. Figure 1 from Chan and Marsh (2024, WP) plots the intraday distribution of earnings announcement frequencies in recent years. In contrast to the situation decades ago, when over 80% of earnings announcements were released during trading hours (Patell and Wolfson, 1982 TAR), after-hour earnings announcements have become dominant nowadays.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recently, at the request of my colleagues, I have been working on parsing the comprehensive Glassdoor dataset for 2,219 firms and gathering insights from employees residing in various states across the United States. In this blog post, I will share the detailed techniques and algorithms to fulfill this task. For readers who want to access the codes directly, please jump to &lt;a href=&#34;https://mengjiexu.com/post/get-insights-into-labor-market-with-glassdoor/#deploy-the-parser&#34;&gt;this section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-glassdoor&#34;&gt;Why Glassdoor&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Glassdoor has been offering rich insights for practitioners, stakeholders, and researchers and seems to continue to do so in the foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracing The Origins of EDGAR Downloads</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/deal-edgar-logs/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;1-introduction&#34;&gt;1. Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/view/mengjiexu/&#34;&gt;My research&lt;/a&gt; centers around how market participants act upon their perceived informational advantages over others. And because of this, I have always found it intriguing to leverage people&amp;rsquo;s digital traffic in accessing firms&amp;rsquo; EDGAR filings to capture the dynamics of market participants&amp;rsquo; information sets. During my explorations, I found &lt;a href=&#34;http://IPinfo.io/&#34;&gt;IPinfo.io&lt;/a&gt; generously provided all the registered users with the bulk data for organization to which the IP address is registered. Per their invitation, I am pleased to share my methods on distinguishing EDGAR downloads from different stakeholder groups, especially those from the retail and institutional investors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Gain Insights From Organized Retail Investors in Reddit Wallstreetbets</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/deal-reedit/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In January 2021, a group of retail investors noticed that several hedge funds had taken large short positions on GameStop&amp;rsquo;s stock, essentially betting that its price would decline. Retail investors, many of whom were part of the Reddit community &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/&#34;&gt;Wall Street Bets&lt;/a&gt; (hereafter, WSB), saw an opportunity to drive up the stock&amp;rsquo;s price and squeeze the short sellers. They began buying GameStop shares &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, causing the stock price to skyrocket. Noticeably, according to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wsj.com/articles/keith-gill-drove-the-gamestop-reddit-mania-he-talked-to-the-journal-11611931696&#34;&gt;Wall Street Journal article published on Jan. 29, 2019&lt;/a&gt;, many online investors say advocacy from &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keith_Gill_(investor)&#34;&gt;Keith Gill&lt;/a&gt;, a 34-year-old marketing professional and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) known by the Reddit username &lt;em&gt;DeepFuckingValue&lt;/em&gt;,  &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;helped turn them into a force powerful enough&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Replicate Brogaard Stock Volatility Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/replicate-brogaard-stock-volatility-decomposition/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 10 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/replicate-brogaard-stock-volatility-decomposition/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Having recognized the potential of the stock volatility decomposition method introduced by Brogaard et al. (2022, RFS) in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mengjiexu.com/post/an-information-based-decomposition-of-stock-price/&#34;&gt;my previous blog&lt;/a&gt;, I will show how to implement this method to empower your own research in this blog.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For readers with time constraints, the codes for implementing this variance decomposition method can be approched via &lt;a href=&#34;https://mengjiexu.com/post/replicate-brogaard-stock-volatility-decomposition/#pack-codes&#34;&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As replicating Brogaard et al. (2022, RFS) requires some manipulations on the VAR estimation outputs, I took some time to figure out the theory and estimation of the reduced-form VAR coefficients, Impulse response functions (IRFs), structural IRFS, orthogonalized IRFs, and variance decomposition and summarized what I&amp;rsquo;ve got in a three-blog series about VAR.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Estimations of VAR, IRFs, and Variance Decomposition in Stata</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/common-practice-of-var-estimation-in-stata/</link>

      <guid>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/common-practice-of-var-estimation-in-stata/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This blog is the second one of my 3 blogs about VAR model. In this blog, I will introduce how to use Stata&amp;rsquo;s integrated commands &lt;code&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;svar&lt;/code&gt; to estimate the VAR model, which is also the common practices for researchers in VAR estimation. While it has little incremental value to an extant blog &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.stata.com/2016/08/09/vector-autoregressions-in-stata/&#34;&gt;Vector autoregressions in Stata written by David Schenck&lt;/a&gt;, this blog will serve as an important benchmark for my manual calculations of all the major VAR estimation outputs in &lt;a href=&#34;https://mengjiexu.com/post/manually-replicate-statas-practice-in-estimations-of-var-irfs-and-variance-decomposition/&#34;&gt;the next blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Seeking Alpha From Market Participants&#39; Information Acquisition Actions</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/seeking-alpha-from-investor-attention/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 08 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/seeking-alpha-from-investor-attention/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Just like the trading imbalance could be a powerful signal for upcoming stock price movement, investors&amp;rsquo; information acquisition actions are also indicative for future security returns. According to Lee and So (2015), acquiring information is costly for investors and thus they only do so when the expected profits can cover the relative costs. Ceteris paribus, securities which attract more investor attention may have a higher likelihood of experiencing abnormal stock volatility from which a sophisticated investor can cultivate Alphas.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Collect Daily Level Short Sale Data From FINRA With Low Costs and Low Delay</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/collect-daily-level-short-selling-data-with-no-costs-and-no-delay/</link>

      <guid>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/collect-daily-level-short-selling-data-with-no-costs-and-no-delay/</guid>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;short-sale-data-matters&#34;&gt;Short Sale Data Matters&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Short selling, by definition, occurs when an investor borrows a security and sells it on the open market, planning to buy it back later for less money. Short-sellers bet on, and profit from, a drop in a security&amp;rsquo;s price.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Being timely informed about equities&amp;rsquo; short-selling status is of interests to broad market participants. For investors, short-selling is a power signal indicating the existed or, sometimes, upcoming market sentiment, both matter a lot when making the trading decisions. For firms, the level of short-selling is a highly relevant indicator for market monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Utilize Google Search as an Integrated Data Source</title>
      <link>https://xumj2021.github.io/post/utilize-google-search/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I find Google Search is a fairly nice platform as an integrated information source, especially when the information that you want has not been collected by the existed database, or - you think it&amp;rsquo;s not worthwhile to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, in my last project, I need to collect firms&amp;rsquo; Twitter account for 3000+ different companies. However, there is no established database which I have access to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The solution I found is to submit firm name or firm Ticker plus &amp;lsquo;Twitter Account&amp;rsquo; to Google search, record the most relevant search results, and write them into my excel sheet - That is basically what I would do if I am hand-collecting the data and means  huge workload if I actually do it. But if I can write a script to automate this procedure and let the computer repeat this procedure for 3000+ times, things would be much easier.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;i-motivation&#34;&gt;I. Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency traders (HFTs) are market participants that are characterized by the high speed (typically in milliseconds level) with which they react to incoming news, the low inventory on their books, and the large number of trades they execute (SEC, 2010). According to Breckenfelder (2019, WP), The high-frequency trading industry grew rapidly since its inception in the mid-2000s and has represented about 50% of trading in US equity markets by 2017 (down from a 2009 peak, when it topped 60%).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Twitter API: Door To Social Media Analysis I</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last few decades, a series of papers published in top accounting journals have repeatedly proved that &lt;strong&gt;Twitter data could empower very fascinating research ideas&lt;/strong&gt;. To give readers an &lt;strong&gt;intuition about the potential of Twitter data&lt;/strong&gt;, I would roughly show three directions and their relative examples which I have deepest impression through my limited personal reading experience.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wisdom of crowds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram (2018, TAR) found opinions of individuals tweeted just prior to a firm’s earnings announcement can predict its earnings and announcement returns. Similarly, Tang (2018, JAR) showed the customer responses towards a firm&amp;rsquo;s products in Twitter obtain a siginificant predictive power for the upcoming firm sales.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please see the background information about Twitter API v2 in my last blogpost &lt;a href=&#34;https://mengjiexu.com/post/door-to-twitter-analysis-i/&#34;&gt;Twitter API: Door To Social Media Analysis I&lt;/a&gt;. In this blogpost, I will replicate the Tweets extraction porcess of Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram (2018, TAR), which found that opinions of individuals tweeted just prior to a firm’s earnings announcement can predict its earnings and announcement returns.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a perspective of implementation, we need to get all the tweets which mentioned a given firm in a specified time range. Consistent to the paper&amp;rsquo;s definition, the targeted tweets should:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The WRDS-SAS Studio seems to be suspended soon. As a big fan of this cloud platform, I have to find something alternative to make my data extraction from WRDS replicable. Compiled from a series of WRDS guidances (you can find them in the &lt;strong&gt;Reference&lt;/strong&gt; part), this blog will introduce how to exploit WRDS cloud via Python.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The biggest advantage of WRDS Cloud is that you don&amp;rsquo;t have to download everything to your computer but just deal with the massive data using the computing source of WRDS Cloud. Following this blog, one can quickly establish a python-wrds cloud workflow without checking various manuals.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

However, as a typical finance terminal designed for traders,  it&amp;rsquo;s technically hard to use as a database  for scholars. This blog will introduce how to prepare your Bloomberg Terminal for massive data extracting and how to access data via Bloomberg API.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;deploy-operation-enviornment&#34;&gt;Deploy Operation Enviornment&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;bloomberg-access&#34;&gt;Bloomberg Access&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Get a Bloomberg Terminal and of course a valid Bloomberg Account&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure the Bloomberg Add-in in Excel in this terminal works&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From NOAA ISD Dataset to Panel Data</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The motivation to clean this dataset is from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304405X21000921&#34;&gt;Mukherjee et al. (2021, JFE)&lt;/a&gt;. In this paper, the authors documented that one can get ahead-of-announcement estimation about the storage hubs for crude oil in the US from satellite images and trade on it. This will decrease the market reaction around the release of official figures because the oil storage information has been partially revealed during the traders&amp;rsquo; arbitrage before announcement due to traders&amp;rsquo; use of satellite images. To establish the causality between traders&amp;rsquo; satellite image use and the lower market reaction around official figure release, this paper adopted cloudiness in the storage sites as Instrument Variable because the satellite images will be more obscure and thus less useful when the weather is cloudy. It turns out that the lowered market reaction is indeed less prominent during cloudy weeks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>About My name is Mengjie Xu. I obtained my PhD from the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management in April 2024 and will join Duke University as an Assistant Professor of Accounting.&#xA;My research focuses on how information system design shapes strategic interactions among market participants and the associated market outcomes.&#xA;Focusing on discovering welfare-improving information system designs and seeking ways to enhance existing ones when they fall short, I am dedicated to conducting research that has real-world relevance and can be of practical use in improving market dynamics.</description>

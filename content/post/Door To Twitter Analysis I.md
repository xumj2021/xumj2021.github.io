## Motivation

In the last few decades, a series of papers published in top accounting journals have repeatedly proved that **Twitter data could empower very fascinating research ideas**. To give readers an **intuition about the potential of Twitter data**, I would roughly show three directions and their relative examples which I have deepest impression through my limited personal reading experience.

- **Wisdom of crowds**

  Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram (2018, TAR) found opinions of individuals tweeted just prior to a firm’s earnings announcement can predict its earnings and announcement returns. Similarly, Tang (2018, JAR) showed the customer responses towards a firm's products in Twitter obtain a siginificant predictive power for the upcoming firm sales.

- **Information dissemination**

  Blankespoor, Miller, and White (2013, TAR) illustrated that firms who disseminate their earnings announcements via Twitter besides traditional dissemination channels (e.g., SEC EDGAR, business press, firm websites, etc) have higher maket visibility (e.g., bigger liquidity around earnings announcements, greater market depths, etc), which is especially crucial for samll and medium enterprises. Based on this idea, Jung, Naughton, Tahoun, and Wang (2018, TAR) showed that firms strategically use social media like Twitter as an extra information dissemination channel. Specifically, they found firms are less likely to disseminate their earnings in Twitter if they are underperforming.

- **Risk management**

  Lee, Hutton, and Shu (2015, JAR) noticed that the very special feature of Twitter, compared to traditional information dissemination intermediaries, is that firms can communicate quickly and directly with their stakeholders via their Twitter accounts. Utilizing this interactive feature, the authors found that firms who directly communicate with stakeholders in Twitter after the outbreak of crisis (e.g., product recall) experience attenuated negative market reaction.

Having made clear about the potential of Twitter data, in this blogpost I will briefly **introduce some necesary background information which lays a base for efficiently obtaining a tailored dataset** using [Twitter API v2](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/getting-started/about-twitter-api). *<u>A sample project which replicates the Tweets extraction process of Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram (2018, TAR) will be discussed in the next blogpost.</u>*

## Get Access To Twitter API v2

To make any request to the Twitter API, you must first apply for a developer account and have your use case approved. **Twitter offers generous free academic developer accounts** which provides qualified academic researchers access to elevated access and enhanced functionality (compared to [standard version](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access)), including access to the [full-archive search endpoint](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search), a higher monthly [Tweet cap](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/projects/overview#tweet-cap) (e.g., 10,000,000 tweets per month), and enhanced filtering capabilities with the filtered stream and recent search endpoint. One can apply for an academic developer account via this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/petition/academic/is-it-right-for-you.html). To make sure the account will be properly used, Twitter might require you to porvide the following information:

> - Your full name as it is appears on your institution’s documentation
> - Links to webpages that help establish your identity; provide one or more of the following:
>   - A link to your profile in your institution’s faculty or student directory
>   - A link to your Google Scholar profile
>   - A link to your research group, lab or departmental website where you are listed
> - In English, describe your methodology for analyzing Twitter data, Tweets, and/or Twitter users. Minimum 200 characters.
>   - In other words, what types of analyses do you intend to perform with Twitter data? This should be more descriptive of your tactics than the question above.
> - Will your research present Twitter data individually or in aggregate?
>   - Think of it as presenting individual Tweets or users vs. aggregate statistics or models.

To maintain a well-functioning developer community and also avoid potential litigation risks, please do not forget to check the [multiple policies](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy) you need to comply, the [restricted uses](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases) of your Twitter API account, and the [speed limit of requests](https://developer.twitter.com/en/products/twitter-api/academic-research). 

The dashboard of the developer portal is as follows. Click the little sign I have circled in Figure 1, you will have the various tokens showed in Figure 2.

<center>
    <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);" 
    src="https://fig-lianxh.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/dash.png" width=500 height=400>
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">Figure 1: Dashboard of the Twitter Developer Account</div>
</center>

Twitter defines the different tokens as following:

- Think of the **API key** as the user name that represents your App when making API requests. It helps us verify who you are.

- Our **API Key Secret** is like a password and helps verify your API Key. 

- **Bearer Token** is an Access Token used in authentication that allows you to pull specific data.

    <img style="border-radius: 0.3125em;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 4px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.12),0 2px 10px 0 rgba(34,36,38,.08);" 
    src="https://fig-lianxh.oss-cn-shenzhen.aliyuncs.com/keys.png" width=500 height=400>
    <br>
    <div style="color:orange; border-bottom: 1px solid #d9d9d9;
    display: inline-block;
    color: #999;
    padding: 2px;">Figure 2: Generate Access Token</div>
</center>

For the safety of your developer account, you might not want to have the tokens explicitly displayed in your codes. In such case, you could basically [set the tokens as the enviornment variables](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7501678/set-environment-variables-on-mac-os-x-lion) in your terminal and just cite the environment variables when writing codes. 

```shell
(base) mengjiexu@MacBook-von-mengjie ~ % vim ~/.zsh_profile
export CONSUMER_KEY='<Your API Key>'
export CONSUMER_SECRET='<Your API Key>'
export BEARER_TOKEN=$BEARER_TOKEN:'<Your Bearer Token>'
(base) mengjiexu@MacBook-von-mengjie ~ % source ~/.zsh_profile
```

## What Can Twitter API v2 Do?

According to [the official manual](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/early-access), one can achieve the following functions via Twitter API v2.

Twitter also provides a series of sample codes to realize those functions using various programming languages (e.g., Java, Node.js, Python, R, Ruby). The codes are public available at [Twitter Developer's Github Repositories](https://github.com/twitterdev/Twitter-API-v2-sample-code). I will introduce the most frequently used functions that researchers would use in the subsequent blogposts.

## Data Objects

Before we move to the sample project, it's necessary to make clear which data is available. According to the [official manual](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet), there are three primary types (`Tweet`, `User`, `Space`) of objects and three expanded ones (`Media`, `Place`, `Poll`). Each of them has a series of fields ready for requests.

Those objects are:

- [Tweet object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet) - Tweets are the basic building block of all things Twitter. The Tweet object has a long list of ‘root-level’ fields, such as `id`, `text`, and `created_at`. Tweet objects are also the ‘parent’ object to several child objects including `user`, `media`, `poll`, and `place`. Use the field parameter `tweet.fields` when requesting these root-level fields on the Tweet object. 
- [User object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/user) - The user object contains Twitter user account metadata describing the referenced user. The user object is the primary object returned in the [User Lookup](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/introduction.html) endpoint. When requesting additional user fields on this endpoint, simply use the fields parameter `user.fields`.
- [Space object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/space) - Spaces allow expression and interaction via live audio conversations. The Space data dictionary contains relevant metadata about a Space; all the details are updated in real time.
- [Media object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/media) - Media refers to any image, GIF, or video attached to a Tweet. The media object is not a primary object on any endpoint, but can be found and expanded in the Tweet object. 
- [Place objects](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/place) - The place tagged in a Tweet is not a primary object on any endpoint, but can be found and expanded in the Tweet resource.
- [Poll object](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/poll) - A poll included in a Tweet is not a primary object on any endpoint, but can be found and expanded in the Tweet object.  

For research purposes, the most frequently used objects are `Tweet object` and `User object`. Thus, I will display the field lists of these two objects here. One could also find more detailed information about those fields in the [official manual](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet).

## Summary and Upcoming Posts

In this blogpost, I have introduced the necessary background information about Twitter API v2. To give the readers a big picture about how Twitter API can serve for one's research project, I will replicate the Tweets extraction process of Bartov, Faurel, and Mohanram (2018, TAR) aforementioned in the next blogpost.
